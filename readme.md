# BeTheLemon

This is my first Laravel blog project.

# About

The project is about making a functional Blog using Laravel.

The goals were to understand Laravel core functionalities and try to implements them in a real project.

Their is ways to push further this project:

* add Ajax in crud operations
* add multilevel comment system
* add tests to ensure the app is safe and secure
* add a newsletter system
...

This project allows me to use Laravel in another professional project to make a local app that manage runs event for a running club who makes 4 runs per years (800 runners each)
